## Brief <a name="brief"></a>
As specified in the project brief, the following applications are to be deployed:
- A front-end version of the PetClinic WebApp coded in angular js (<a href="https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular">Link</a>)
- A back-end, restful API version of the PetClinic WebApp coded in java (<a href="https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest">Link</a>)
Workflows, both deployment and development, must be automated with the following considerations in mind:
- Which tools and technologies, covered over the training period, will be used
- Multiple environments to facilitate testing
- Automated building and continuous deployment based on VCS modifications
- A record of total costs incurred
